# Student Performance Visualization with Matplotlib

This repository contains my practice project using **Matplotlib** based on the W3Schools Python Matplotlib Tutorial.  
It covers the basics of creating different charts such as line, scatter, bar, histogram, and pie plots to visualize student performance data.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Description
The project visualizes student performance data across different subjects using multiple types of plots:  
1. **Line Plot** â†’ Shows a studentâ€™s marks across Math, Science, and English.  
2. **Scatter Plot** â†’ Compares Math vs Science marks for multiple students.  
3. **Bar Chart** â†’ Displays subject-wise average marks.  
4. **Histogram** â†’ Shows distribution of marks across all subjects.  
5. **Pie Chart** â†’ Shows study hours percentage for each subject.  
6. **Subplot** â†’ Combines multiple charts in one figure.
